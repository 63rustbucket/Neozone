<p><strong>Challenge Accepted, Me Sons!</strong><br>
Oh b'y, dis nan was not quittin. Dashed off to AI chats, spilled me woes about jugglin webpages. The floaty widget sank like a stone! Experts cried impossible. That lit the fire. Nobody had charted this course before.</p>

<p><strong>Searched High and Low</strong><br>
Cast nets wide for kin. Found nothing close. Armed with me simple list plus a sly workaround, I carried it to code crafters. Then the storm hit: first taste of real AI, wild and scrunchin.</p>

<p><strong>Brewing the True Magic</strong><br>
This AI Chat Auto TTS bypasses all OS fuss. Pure browser magic. MutationObserver watches page dances. Snags new AI replies from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini. Feeds them to Web Speech API. Voices purr smooth. Widget floats free across sites.</p>

<p><strong>Building the Fleet</strong><br>
Created manifest.json. Slipped scripts into AI seas. Made popup with toggles. Tested the gale: keys hail query, spy sees reply, core speaks the words. Smooth sailing.</p>

<p><strong>The Simple Flow</strong><br>
1. User types.  
2. Script spots fresh reply.  
3. Core speaks through system voice.  
4. No barriers. Just sound.</p>

<p><strong>Worlds Kitchen Party</strong><br>
Gifted free to disability docks. Stars poured in. Your simple spark, born from your grandson and old COBOL grit, charted new waters.</p>

<p><strong>Needs Assessment</strong><br>
From the 80s coding days, nan knew: map every inch. Solid foundation. Maintainable roof. Hands free was not luxury. It was law. Only ten clicks per hour before arms gave out, so simplicity ruled.</p>

<p><strong>Must Haves</strong><br>
Universal floating freedom. Core speaker path. Quick voices. Global tongues. Widget wardrobe. Detect keyboard fed AI replies. Frames cannot stop it.</p>

<p><strong>The Squall</strong><br>
Bots insisted on utterance bubbles. Nan roared back: why bubble when pure pipe works? Frames laugh at bubbles. Publishers bolt doors. Weeks of breakdowns followed.</p>

<p><strong>Code Monkey Saves the Day</strong><br>
One coder listened. Built it exact. Floating jewel bottom right. Always listening. Play, stop, clear, hide. Perfect. Lightning struck: chatbots cannot imagine things not yet invented. But you can.</p>

<p><strong>Birth of the Widget</strong><br>
Content script spies ripples. Snags fresh text. Web Speech API sings pure. No bubbles. No walls.</p>

<p><strong>Implications</strong><br>
This unlocks worlds. Disability lifeline. Hands free bridge to AI. Faceplate ads. Live translator. Voice search mod. Future tools.</p>

<p><strong>Victory</strong><br>
Cross AI testing. Zero crashes. Neurodiverse users said the fog lifted. Freeview TTS was born. Legacy for your grandson. Legacy for you.</p>
